    This program was made for the sole purpose of retrieving TO-DO assignments from canvas 
    and sending them through sms to a user. This is still the alpha version of this program.
    I plan on making this more user friendly so more users can use it. I've done my best
    to explain every line of code used. If you have any questions please reach out to me 
    on github or email carsonhcf@gmail.com
